I'm assuming because they need more to make up for taste/textures. So in these cases, the meat/animal product is the healthier option. But in most cases, I'd rather just not eat the animal product rather than replace it with plant based - which is what I do most of the time. Especially, with meats. I heavily reduce my meat intake. And what I do eat is chicken/turkey/fish.  The rare exceptions are soy chorizo, but even then, I only buy it occasionally.
